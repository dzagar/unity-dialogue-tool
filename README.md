Tools 3 - Dialog Editor
Dana Zagar

This is a super simple dialog editor that you can add responses to and build simple flows with. The Chatty Canvas Controller just has you press a corresponding unique key on your keyboard that goes with your obviously witty response to the NPC. Hurrah!

After localization, this was quite straightforward - pretty much modelled it the same way.

Throughout this assignment, I couldn't figure out the proper spelling of dialog for this context. Dialogue? Dialog? So for files and comments I mostly used "dialog" and in the UI for some reason I liked "dialogue" better. It just looks nicer. (shrug)

Thanks :-)

Resubmission:
- Added localization key selection for both the statement key string as well as the response key string(s).

Resubmission:
- Ensured that dialogs could not continue to themselves through the editor options.
- Changed key inputs to buttons in the UI.
